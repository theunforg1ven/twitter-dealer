Application for getting twitter posts, media and threads.

## 📌Description
I tried to add a lot of useful features during site creation. You can watch list of computer games, search for the game you need, search game by specific category, contact me, leave main and sub comments on the game page. Also you can add game to the cart and make an order. You can create an account, login yourself and reset your password. Also you can write messages in chat. Hope, you'll enjoy my web site ^-^

Also, backend part was written using ASP .NET Core Web API and EF Core and frontend part was written as an Angular SPA application.
